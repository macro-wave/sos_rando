# Helpful Tracker Info
***
### RANDOMIZER OPTIONS PANEL
The options panel drops down from the gear icon in the top left tabbed section.

**World Access Options**
*Forbidden Cavern*
- Closed: Vanilla; both the cavern key and bosslug block progress to the rest of the world
- Open: Behaves as though the wall in the central room is open and the laser bridge is on from the start. Key is still needed for a few checks.

*Stonemasons Elevator*
- Malkomud: Requires defeating Malkomud to activate the elevator
- Open: Elevator is active at start, and can be accessed from both Outpost and Coral Cascades

*Skylands Bridge*
- Dweller of Strife: Must defeat the dweller at Clockwork Castle to open up the water bridge and reach the sklyands warp. Skylands can still be accessed if Puntie's name is acquired, or if player can fly to the island.
- Open: The bridge is open at the start.

*Sea of Stars*
- Vanilla: The major "swan song" tasks are necessary to reach Serai's world. These include hydralion, toadcano, and being able to open the Zephyr crystal in skylands. The player also needs the magic seashell.
- Magic Seashell: The sea is open, but the magic seashell is required to make the dive
- Open: The sea is open and can be traversed as long as the player can sail.

*Speedball Network*
- Closed: The player needs to activate the network at Estristae in order to use it.
- Open: Speedballs are available from all stations at the start.

*Infinite Abyss*
- Catalyst: Must defeat Catalyst in Sky Base to open up the abyss
- Open: The abyss is open from the start. Like other whirlpools, the player needs the magic seashell to enter.

**Shuffle Options**
*Shopsanity*
This mode adds slots from the various merchants and shopkeepers to the shuffled locations.
- *"Unique"* will only add one-time purchase slots as checks. These include recipes, music sheets, and relics (alumni tokens).
- *"All"* will add every shop slot, including ingredients, snacks, and equipment slots.
- Some shops are transient (they disappear permanently after some game event). These are:
    - Cataclysm Brisk Merchant
    - Hortence at Maelstrom Point
    - Locket at Clockwork Castle
  Transient shops are not included as rando locations regardless of the options.

*Quizsanity*
If turned on, the reward for every quiz, both casual and expert, is included as a location, and the loremaster location requires passing all quizzes.
Otherwise, the loremaster check alone is included and only requires one quiz.

*Conch Rewards & Fishing Rewards*
Adds the rewards given for collecting conches/discovering fish species as checks.

**Sequence Skip Options**
*Skip Prologue*
Equivalent of using Solstice Diploma. Excludes all locations in the prologue up to the Forbidden Cavern.

*Fleshmancer's Lair Warp*
Behaves as though the warp at the entrance to the lair is available from the start. Does not exclude any checks in the dungeon, but makes it possible to reach the final boss without going through the dungeon or getting items like the suspicious fish.

**Logic Options**
*Throne w/out Belt Buckle*
If turned on, the tracker will assume a player knows the path to Throne of the Queen without needing the story hint.
Otherwise, if the player can access Cerulean Expanse but does not have Joce's Belt Buckle, the check will be marked yellow for "accessible out-of-logic"

### SPECIAL ITEMS

**Fishing and Recipes**
The *Checklists* tab has item grids for fish discovered and for recipes obtained.
Fish clicked counts towards the fishing lodge checks on Settlers Island (only visible with *Shuffle Fishing Rewards* active).
Recipes only affect logic for the robot in repine (unofficially) named *Chomper*. To access that check, at least one recipe must be obtained for each of 5 categories: Sweet, Warming, Meaty, Light, and From the Water. Some foods match 2 of these, some none. A table showing the recipes for each category can be found in the [compendium document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pMN6Ia4cQehQ_SDULeH43F3FtbKHTe2eAo8T-NpG1K8/edit#gid=0).

**Progressive Items**
Wheels items (figurines and leveled wheels) are treated as one progressive item, as the order they are obtained in the vanilla game is fixed. Progressing the item to the *Mage Figurine* is the minimum to unlock regular wheels champions, with the exception of the Repine champion which requires the *Deployable wheels table*. The *Watchmaker* requires defeating all champions, which in vanilla logic coincides with progressing this item to the *Platinum Wheel*.

The *Coral/Cobalt Hammer* and the *Seashell/Magic Seashell* have been respectively treated as progressive items.

*Question Packs* are treated as separate items because they are not necessarily obtained in order and have respective rewards in the vanilla game.

### Other Notes
The names of *Travel Golems* (represented by their icons in the *Characters* tab) have been included as possible logical items, as they restrict travel between islands. Shuffling the names may be a possible feature in an implemented randomizer.

The *Nightmare Vespertine* and *Cataclysm Brisk* areas are unique in that they cannot be revisited outside their respective chapters. Cataclysm Brisk is not currently implemented. Nightmare Vespertine will currently change to normal on the Home World map after obtaining the Map item. Frankly I have no idea how to deal with this logic.
