# Sea of Stars Randomizer Map Tracker

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS

This is a prototype pack not yet published for EmoTracker. A randomizer mod for Sea of Stars does not currently exist. **However!** If you are interested in helping develop a randomizer consider checking these out:

[Archipelago Discord](https://discord.gg/enNTGRY2) - search for Sea of Stars in the future-game-design thread


Design of this pack, if a randomizer mod is ever developed, is subject to the implementation of that mod; therefore inclusions, exclusions, and logic may change. Current design is based on randomizer ideas and suggestions that may not all be possible.
