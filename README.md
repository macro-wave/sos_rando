# Sea of Stars Randomizer Map Tracker

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS

A randomizer mod for Sea of Stars does not currently exist, nor has any development on such a mod been announced. This is a prototype pack not yet published for EmoTracker.

Design of this pack, if a randomizer mod is ever developed, is subject to the implementation of that mod; therefore inclusions, exclusions, and logic may change. Current design is based on randomizer ideas and suggestions that may not all be possible.
